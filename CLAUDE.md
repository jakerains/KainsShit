# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is Kain the GenAI Alien's personal knowledge base for AI resources, tools, and discoveries. The repository is organized as a curated collection of AI-related content with a playful alien persona theme throughout.

## Key Context

- **Character**: Kain is a friendly alien character who explores and collects AI resources from an extraterrestrial perspective
- **Tone**: Maintain the playful, space-themed personality in all content additions
- **Purpose**: Personal collection and reference repository, not a production codebase

## Repository Structure

The repository contains 9 main directories, each serving a specific purpose for organizing AI content:
- `ai-models/` - Model architectures and implementations
- `tools/` - Scripts and development utilities
- `resources/` - Learning materials
- `experiments/` - AI project playground
- `prompts/` - Prompt engineering examples
- `creative-ai/` - Art, music, and creative AI projects
- `datasets/` - Data resources
- `awesome-links/` - External resource links
- `alien-insights/` - Kain's unique AI perspectives

## Content Guidelines

When adding new content:
1. Each directory has its own README.md explaining its purpose and organization
2. Use markdown files for documentation and resource lists
3. Include Kain's alien commentary and emojis to maintain character consistency
4. Organize resources by category within each directory

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names: `example-resource.md`
- Group related content with descriptive prefixes: `creative-writing.md`, `ai-resources-2025.md`
- Keep names concise but descriptive

## Adding Resources

When adding new AI resources:
1. Place in the appropriate directory based on content type
2. Include brief descriptions and why it's interesting
3. Add Kain's perspective or commentary where appropriate
4. Link to external resources rather than copying content

## Git Workflow

This is a simple repository without complex build processes:
- No build, test, or lint commands required
- Standard git workflow for version control
- The `.gitignore` is configured for common AI/ML project files
